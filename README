ponymenu is quick terminal based application menu

Why is a application menu in the terminal needed?
    If you have many program, such as games, that
    of which you do not known the exact name,
    using a menu is useful.
    And becase it is runs it the terminal it is
    also more comfortable to use the mouse eponiter
    based menu, it is will still work in the TTY.


This package is not complete, but is ready for use,
unfortunely there is no documentation yet, so you
will have the read parts of the code, to learn it.

I suggest aliasing this program to `q`, or whatever
character is under your left ring finger.


Keybindings:

C-q             Quit
EOF             Quit
Tab             Up one level
Left            Erase last search character
Backspace       Erase last search character
Right           Autocomplete search
Enter           Execute or open submenu
